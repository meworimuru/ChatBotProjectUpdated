# ChatBotProjectUpdated
Uses Tensorflow and Keras to train + predict a model
Utilised nltk, TensorFlow, numpy library 

System Requirements: 
- Tensorflow 2.11.0
- Python 3.7.4
- Used Windows 11 OS.(Hopefully, MacOS and Linux will also be able to run)

How to run:
- Change "intents.json" to desired path location
- Type in "python newIntentTrainingFixed.py" to actually run the program
  
In this project, I have learned several techniques:
- Learning about lists/sets types and their properties 
- Learning about how AI Chatbot models actually learn
- Tokenisation and Stemming
- Building an AI training model in TensorFlow
- Learned that AI training models are sensitive to the training data.(Ex. ChatBot will not recognise any other patterns not specified in intents.json and will give seemingly random responses)

(Possible) Future Works
- Better and more complex AI model creation(Ex. Adding additional tokenizing tools of being able to recognise apostrophes. What is -> What's)
- Utilising other neural networks (CNN,etc)
- Adding more data for training
