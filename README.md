# ChatBotProjectUpdated
Uses Tensorflow and Keras to train + predict a model
Utilised nltk, TensorFlow, numpy library 

System Requirements: 
- Tensorflow 2.11.0
- Python 3.7.4
- Used Windows 11 OS.(Hopefully, MacOS and Linux will also be able to run)
  
In this project, I have learned several techniques:
- Learning about lists/sets types and their properties 
- Learning about how AI Chatbot models actually learn
- Tokenisation and Stemming
- Building an AI training model in TensorFlow
